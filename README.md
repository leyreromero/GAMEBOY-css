## Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

This is my first project using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript under the 'bootcamp'training of the Geekshubs Academy.

## Requirements & usage <a name = "requirements"></a>

The only requirement is to have a code editor like "Visual Studio Code" for example.

To start using the app we just have to clik the 'start' button. We will see that the color of the button chages when passing over it with the cursor. When you press the button, the screen will appear in red because no more interactions have been added to it yet.

### Demo & screenshoots
